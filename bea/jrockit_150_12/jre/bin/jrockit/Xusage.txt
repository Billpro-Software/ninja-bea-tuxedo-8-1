                                single-spaced parallel GC mode but may switch
                                to other GC modes dynamically during runtime)
		  pausetime	optimizes the gc-behavior to achieve minimal
                                pause times (initially starts off with 
                                single-spaced concurrent GC mode but may switch
                                to other GC modes dynamically during runtime)
		  deterministic	optimizes the gc-behavior to ensure extremely
                                short pause times and limit the total number of
                                those pauses within a prescribed window (this
                                feature requires a valid license)
