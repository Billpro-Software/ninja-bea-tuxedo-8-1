rpcsimp is a demo of Tuxedo's TxRPC feature. It can be run by following
the procedure outlined below.


1. Copy the files from $TUXDIR/samples/atmi/rpcsimp into a separate DIR for building
   all the application files. 

2. Several environment variables need to be set and exported before using 
   TUXEDO or running any TUXEDO application. They are:
 
        TUXDIR - base directory of the TUXEDO software
        PATH - must include $TUXDIR/bin
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH - must include $TUXDIR/lib on systems that use
                shared libraries (except HP-UX and AIX)
        SHLIB_PATH - HP-UX only: must include $TUXDIR/lib
        LIBPATH - AIX only: must include $TUXDIR/lib
        TUXCONFIG - full pathname of binary tuxconfig file

2. Edit the ubbconfig file and specify the entries present within <....>. 
   These are UNAME, TUXDIR, APPDIR and TUXCONFIG. For UNAME enter the machine
   name (The output of "uname -n" at the command prompt). 

3. Build the TUXEDO config file.
	$ tmloadcf -y ubbconfig

4. Build the application files:
	$ make -f rpcsimp.mk all

5. Boot up the application.
	$ tmboot -y

6. Run the client.
	$ client "HeLlO wOrLd"
