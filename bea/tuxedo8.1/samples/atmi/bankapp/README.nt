SIMPLE BUILD PROCEDURE


The command script "RUNME.cmd" will start an interactive program designed
to lead users through initialization, booting, shutdown and cleanup of
SHM and MP bankapp applications.

This driver program presents menus to the user with defaults that will lead
you through the most effective means of setting up, running, shutting
down and cleaning up a single or multi-node bankapp application.
Anywhere from 1 to 10 nodes may be configured.  The 10 bankapp branches
will be distributed amongst the available nodes.

Requirements:
	1. On remote Windows NT machines, you should go to the bankapp
	   directory and start "runslave.cmd". This program starts an agent
	   that the driver will use to transfer files, run remote commands,
	   etc.  Note that this is an unsecure program and should only be used
	   for runnnig bankapp.
	2. On remote UNIX machine, you need remote shell capabilities.
	   You may need to alter ${HOME}/.rhosts files to allow for this.
	   UNIX sites should be running at least release 5.0 of TUXEDO.
	3. The IP address of all machines must appear in
	   %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.

Once the UBB file has been created and the source files have been propagated
to the remote sites, you can either continue using the driver or use the
command line:
	1. Each site contains a environment setup file named bankvar.mp?.cmd
	   on Windows NT sites and bankvar.mp? on UNIX sites, where ? is the
	   site number [1-10].
	   You can execute this file by typing
		bankvar.mp? [on a NT site]
	   or
		. ./bankvar.mp? [on a UNIX site].
	   In both cases, replace the question mark with the site number.
	2. Refer to steps 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 below for further information,
	   replacing the ubbconfig name with UBB, and the Makefile with
	   bankapp.mak? where the question mark is the site number.

Windows NT note: you can close bankappd as soon as you stop the driver.


OR YOU CAN FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES BELOW TO DO YOUR OWN SETUP, ETC....

INSTALLATION AND BUILD PROCEDURES FOR BANKAPP

The following ten steps and alternates describe two separate 
procedures for building the sample application, bankapp.  
If you want to bring up the application on a single processor
(SHM mode) follow the primary steps--Step 1, Step 2 and so on.
If you want to bring up a networked application on more than
one processor (MP mode), include the alternate steps--Step 1A,
Step 2A and so on.

Consult the TUXEDO System Application Development Guide for a more
detailed description of these procedures.


Step 1: Copy the Software for SHM Mode

On a Windows NT site:
Make a new directory and change to it. Copy all of the source files into that
directory:
	xcopy %TUXDIR%\samples\atmi\bankapp /s

%TUXDIR% is the root directory under which your TUXEDO System
software is installed.

The rest of the steps in this procedure are done in the new directory.

On a UNIX site:
Make a new directory under your $HOME directory and copy all of 
the source files from <TUXDIR>\samples\atmi\bankapp into that directory.
TUXDIR is the root directory under which your TUXEDO System
software is installed.  We're calling the new directory
$HOME/bankapp.  The rest of the steps in this procedure are 
done in the directory $HOME/bankapp.


Step 1A: Copy the Software for MP Mode

The person responsible for installing the TUXEDO System software 
is instructed to see that the executable software is available on 
each machine that will participate in a System/T application.
To bring up bankapp in MP mode we assume that TUXEDO System executables 
are present at all sites but the bankapp source files are only available 
at the master site. We also assume that you have a login on each 
non-master machine as well as on the master.
You need to go through the process of copying and building the bankapp 
software at each site.

Duplicate Step 1, and then from the master site send the bankapp source 
files to your login on each machine in your network.

When you have copied the bankapp source files to each site, 
return to the master site.

[Windows NT note: you need a TUXEDO System Development Kit on each machine,
all of which contain the sources for bankapp. However, even if such sources
are available on the UNIX sites as well, you probably want to copy the sources
from the Windows NT machine].


Step 2: Edit bankvar for SHM Mode

bankvar is a bankapp source file that contains environment variables.
The following variables should be edited to give them values appropriate 
for your site.

On a Windows NT site:
The file is called bankvar.cmd. The template is in the nt subdirectory.
Before editing the file, copy the template to the current directory
	copy nt\bankvar bankvar.cmd

Edit bankvar.cmd
MSDEV	Directory where Microsoft development tools are located.
	Default setting is c:\msdev

On a UNIX site:
Edit the bankvar file directly.

TUXDIR 	Root directory of the TUXEDO System.

APPDIR 		Directory in which the banking application resides.
		bankvar initially is set to allow this to default
		to the current working directory, which agrees with
		our intention to use 
			- $HOME/bankapp on UNIX sites
		and
			- the current directory (drive included) on Windows NT
			  sites.

BLKSIZE 	Logical blocksize for the database in bytes.
		Must be an integral multiple of the physical 
		page size of the computer.


Step 2A: Edit bankvar for MP Mode

On each machine used by your application, Edit TUXDIR, APPDIR and BLKSIZE 
in bankvar as in Step 2.  Also edit the following:

DIPCKEY 	IPC key for this site's /D database.  This value will 
		need to be changed if there is more than one instance 
		of bankapp on the system at once or if this IPC key is 
		already used for other purposes.

FSCONFIG 	This value needs to be different for each non-master site.
		In the ubbmp file discussed in Step 3A, each site is 
		identified with LMID=SITEn, where n is a numeric identifier.
		On UNIX sites:
			Set FSCONFIG to ${APPDIR}/bankdln, where n agrees with 
			the site number.  This value is used by crbankdb and 
			other database utilities.
		On Windows NT sites:
			Set FSCONFIG to %APPDIR%\bankdln, with n substituted as
			explained for UNIX sites.


Step 3: Edit and Run the makefile for SHM Mode

On Windows NT sites:
The template for the makefile is in nt\bankapp.mak. Copy the template to
the current directory:
	copy nt\bankapp.mak

Edit bankapp.mak and change TUXDIR and APPDIR to the same values as in 
bankvar. When you are satisfied that TUXDIR and APPDIR have the correct values,
enter the following command:
	nmake -f bankapp.mak > build.out 2>&1

Check build.out to make sure the build was successful.

On UNIX:
Edit bankapp.mk and change TUXDIR and APPDIR to the same values as in 
bankvar.  When you are satisfied
that TUXDIR and APPDIR have the correct values, enter the
following command:

	nohup make -f bankapp.mk&

Check nohup.out to make sure the build was successful.

Step 3A: Edit and Run the makefile for MP Mode

Edit bank.h on each site to make the following changes:

	#define	SITEREP	{ 1, 6 }	/* for 2 sites */
	#define	NSITE		2	/* for 2 sites */

Then edit the Makefile and run the build command as mentionned above.


Step 4: Edit the ubbshm Configuration File for SHM Mode

Copy the ubbshm file to the current directory.
	copy nt\ubbshm ubbshm 

The configuration file, often referred to as UBBCONFIG, is the source 
file that contains a complete description of an application.  In Step 6
the configuration file is compiled into the TUXCONFIG file.

In the delivered version of bankapp, the following parameters need 
to be checked:

IPCKEY 		This parameter may or may not need to be reset depending 
		on whether it is unique across the computer.  If yours is 
		the only application on the machine using IPC resources, 
		you can leave this value as is.

UID/GID 	On UNIX sites:
			Set the value for these to your user-id and group-id
			as displayed by the UNIX system command, id(1).
		On Windows NT sites:
			Set these values to 0.

<SITE1's uname>	In the MACHINES section, substitute the node name 
		of your computer
		On UNIX sites:
			as displayed by command, uname -n
		On Windows NT sites:
			the computer name as it appears in the Control Panel
			System entry.
<TUXDIR1>	The root directory of the TUXEDO System.

<APPDIR1>	The directory from which you are running the application.

Step 4A: Edit the ubbmp Configuration File for MP Mode
Copy the ubbmp file to the current directory.
	Copy nt\ubbmp ubbmp

A configuration file for MP mode need only be generated on the Master node
since it will be propagated to the other nodes during boot up.  This step
need only be done on the master node.

Edit IPCKEY and UID/GID as described in Step 3.  Edit the <SITEn's uname>,
<TUXDIRn> and <APPDIRn> parameters to provide the processor names, root
TUXEDO directories and application directories for machines in your
configuration.  ubbmp defines two sites; if you have more than two add
an entry for each additional site.

In addition, check the following parameters:

LMID		The logical machine address for each machine defined.
		Also make sure that the n value for each SITEn is unique.

TYPE 		If your network includes machines of different types
		(for example, both 3B2's and 386's), use the TYPE
		parameter to assign type names.

OPENINFO 	In the GROUPS section, each OPENINFO parameter must
		have an fsconfig value that matches the FSCONFIG set 
		in the bankvar file on that machine.

NETWORK 	There are three parameters that must be set in the
		NETWORK section.  Check the Application Development
		Guide for details.


Step 5: Create Site Databases in SHM Mode

This step creates three databases on a single processor so you can 
simulate the data dependent routing you get with a networked system.
Follow these steps to create the databases:

	1. Set the environment by typing:
	   On a Windows NT site: bankvar
	   On a UNIX site: . ./bankvar
	2. Run crbank, which in turn runs crbankdb once for 
	   each database to be created.
	3. After the databases have been created, run cleandb

[Note: once the environment is loaded, you don't need to run the bankvar
command again each time you run a command]

Step 5A: Create Site Databases in MP Mode

If you are running in MP mode, create the database on each site as follows:

	2. Run crbankdb to create the bank database for this site.


Step 6: Create the TUXCONFIG File

In either SHM or MP mode, enter the following command line:

tmloadcf -y <ubbconfig>	# Specify ubbshm for SHM mode, ubbmp for MP mode


Step 7: Create the Transaction Log in SHM Mode

Before an application is booted for the first time a Universal Device 
List (UDL) entry for the transaction log must exist at all sites and 
the transaction log itself must exist at the master site.  bankapp has 
a shell script, crtlog, that does this task for you.

Enter the following command:

	crtlog -m


Step 7A: Create the Transaction Log in MP Mode

See the explanation in Step 7 above, then run the crtlog program as follows:

Master site:  crtlog -m

At all non-master sites:  crtlog


Step 8: Start the tlisten Process in MP Mode

The tlisten process should be running on each node of an MP
application.

Use the following command:

On Windows NT sites:
	tlisten -l <nlsaddr>

On UNIX sites:
	tlisten -d /dev/<devname> -l <nlsaddr>

where: 

	<devname> is the device name of your network provider;
		  for example, starlan.  If you use Sockets,
		  the -d parameter is not needed.

	<nlsaddr> must match the NLSADDR parameter in the
		  NETWORK section of your UBBCONFIG file.
		  Will be different for each node.

Step 9: Boot the Application Servers

This step must be done from the master site.  The environment variable
TUXCONFIG must be set and exported.  (This was done in Step 5 or Step 5A, 
if you're following the complete procedure)

Use the following command to boot the application:

	tmboot -y

tmboot gives you feedback about servers started.


Step 10: Populate the Databases

Run the populate script from any site.
On Windows NT sites:
	nt\populate

On UNIX sites:
	populate

Step 11: Run the clients:
On Windows NT sites:
	start bankappn

On UNIX sites:
	run
