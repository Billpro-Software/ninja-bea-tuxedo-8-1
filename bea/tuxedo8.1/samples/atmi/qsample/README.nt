This is a brief description of the TUXEDO /Q Application.
A more comprehensive look can be found in the TUXEDO ETP System,
Release 6.1, TUXEDO Sytem/Q Guide.

The sample /Q application is very similar to the application in
simpapp. It consists of a single server offering a single
service, "STRING",  which converts the string "this is a q example" from 
lower case to upper case.  The service is called STRING.  The client enqueues 
a request for this service. The request is placed on the request 
queue, "STRING," by the TMQUEUE server. The request is handled by the 
TMQFORWARD server.  This server removes the request from the request queue, 
sends it to the server for processing, and places the results on the reply 
queue, "RPLYQ."

You should probably copy the sample files to your own directory,
since some files must be edited and you might also want to experiment 
with the client and server code. The changes that must be made are to
set TUXDIR to the location of the TUXEDO software and to set APPDIR to 
the location of the sample /Q application. These values should replace the
bracketed items. The full path name must be supplied.  The files that 
must be edited are:

		a. ubb.sample	<TUXDIR, APPDIR, machine name>
		b. setenv.cmd	<TUXDIR, APPDIR>
		
Once these files are correct the sample application can be run
by executing the command "nmake /f qsample.nt" This will build the servers, 
create the QUEUE and transaction log. 

At this point you should boot the application and run the client.
You can then remove everything. Once this has been run successfully, it 
may be instructive to run each command individually outside of the makefile.

 The files contained in the /Q sample application are:

	client.c - the client program that enqueues the request and
	  dequeues the reply.

	server.c - the server file that	contains the service "STRING"
	  which converts a string from lower case to upper case.

	qsample.nt - a makefile that will build the client and server
	  executables and also creates the logfiles and the queues.

	setenv.cmd - a script that sets the necessary environment variables.	

	ubb.sample - the configuration file that describes the application.

      Before running the sample check whether all permissions are given for creation of new files or TLOG creation might fail.
