SIMPLE BUILD PROCEDURE

The creditapp application is an enhancement of the bankapp
application.
 
The creditapp application is designed to be a 4 domain application.

Step 1: Copy the Software for creditapp.

Make a new directory under your $HOME directory and copy all of 
the source files from <TUXDIR>/samples/atmi/creditapp into that directory.
TUXDIR is the root directory under which your TUXEDO System
software is installed.  We're calling the new directory
$HOME/creditapp.  The rest of the steps in this procedure are 
done in the directory $HOME/creditapp.


Step 2 :
 
On each of the remaining 3 machines :

Make a directory creditapp in a directory that can be used for the application.

We are calling this directory $HOME/creditapp.
 
Make a note of the full directory path for $HOME/creditapp and TUXDIR for 
for each machine . These will be needed in the RUNME.sh script.


Step 3 : On the "master site" execute the "RUNME.sh" script.


The shell script "RUNME.sh" is an interactive program designed to
lead users through initialization, booting, shutdown and cleanup
of the 4 domain creditapp application.  The shell is interactive
and requires no command line arguments.  All you need in the directory
is the source from the creditapp directory.


IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE VALUES FOR RSH AND RCP BE ENNTERED AS THESE ARE

USED TO REMOTE COPY AND EXECUTE THE NECESSARY SCRIPTS.



TUXDIR 	Root directory of the TUXEDO System.

APPDIR 		Directory in which the creditapp application resides.
		crdtvar.dm1 initially is set to allow this to default
		to the current working directory, which agrees with
		our intention to use $HOME/creditapp

BLKSIZE 	Logical blocksize for the database in bytes.
		Must be an integral multiple of the physical 
		page size of the computer.




RUNME.sh
________



OPTION 1. Initialize configuration files and makefiles.

	  This option sets up makefiles, UBBCONFIG and DMCONFIG files that are
	  necessary for the application.

	  All questions must be answered.

	  ENTER the system name : enter uname for machines you are using 
				  beginning with the current machine you are on.


          ENTER TUXDIR for each machine.

	  ENTER APPDIR for each machine.


	  Continue to answer all queries.


	  An example of 4 hexadecimal digits may be (beef, cfff, 6774, aeef).

	  NOTE: EACH MACHINE MUST HAVE A UNIQUE HEX SEQUENCE.


	  

OPTION 2. Copies the files to the other domains in the configuration.


OPTION 3. Builds clients and servers on all machines.                  
           
          NOTE : CAREFULLY CHECK THAT THE BUILDS ARE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ON
		 EACH SITE. IF NECESSARY YOU MAY RUN THE BUILD YOURSELF.

		 ON THE SPECIFIC SITE ENTER

		 nohup make -f CRDT{$MACH}.mk2

		 where ${MACH} is the uname for the machine you are building on.

		      e.g nohup make -f CRDTtux1.mk2




OPTION 4. Builds the databases on each site.                           
           
          NOTE : ON EACH SITE MAKE SURE THE BLKSIZE VALUE IN files 

		 crdt${MACH}.dm1 for the primary site 

		 or crdt${MACH}.dm2 for the remote sites

		 where ${MACH} is the uname for the machine you are building on.

		 ARE CORRECT FOR THAT SPECIFIC MACHINE.



OPTION 5. Generates the tuxconfig and bdmconfig files.                 



All other options are similar to bankapp.


After OPTION 8 : Populate the database

	         Enter q to Quit the menu.



RUNNING CREDITAPP.
__________________


	  On each machine a script run.sh exists.


	  Execute  run.sh.


		   run

 At the response :

 		Is this machine the Credit Card Authorization Center(y/n) ?


	        If machine is the primary machine answer y . 

	        If machine is any other answer n. 


 On the primary machine a different menu will be seen than the other 3 machines.



 All Credit accounts exits on primary machine and all machines can access any
 account.

	 ACCOUNTS 10000000 - 120000000


 Machines 2,3,4 are the enhanced bankapp application.

	 ACCOUNTS 10000 - 39999 exits on machine  2
	 ACCOUNTS 40000 - 79999 exits on machine  3
	 ACCOUNTS 80000 - 109999 exits on machine 4
	  
 All processing is done using the /DOMAIN software.


 A tail -f of the ULOG###### will show the actual processing of the requests.

 On the machine that will process the request enter :

	   tail -f ULOG###### where ###### is today's date.


NOTE : If you see the ERROR : "Database access error",  after the first try then

       you may need to shutdown the system using menu option 9 and reboot

       using menu option 7.
