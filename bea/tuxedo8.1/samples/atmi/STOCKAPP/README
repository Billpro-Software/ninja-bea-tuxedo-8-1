SIMPLE BUILD PROCEDURE

INSTALLATION AND BUILD PROCEDURES FOR STOCKAPP

The following ten steps describe procedures for building the
sample application, STOCKAPP.

Consult the TUXEDO System COBOL Guide for a more detailed description
of these procedures.


Step 1: Copy the Software 

Make a new directory under your $HOME directory and copy all of 
the source files from <TUXDIR>/apps/STOCKAPP into that directory.
TUXDIR is the root directory under which your TUXEDO System
software is installed.  We're calling the new directory
$HOME/STOCKAPP.  The rest of the steps in this procedure are 
done in the directory $HOME/STOCKAPP.


Step 2: Edit STKVAR 

STKVAR is a STOCKAPP source file that contains environment variables.
The following variables should be edited to give them values appropriate 
for your site.

TUXDIR  	Root directory of the TUXEDO System.

APPDIR 		Directory in which the banking application resides.
		STKVAR initially is set to allow this to default
		to the current working directory, which agrees with
		our intention to use $HOME/STOCKAPP

COBDIR		Directory where cobol has been installed, usually
        	/usr/lib/cobol.


Step 3: Edit the UBBCBSHM Configuration File

The configuration file, often referred to as UBBCONFIG, is the source 
file that contains a complete description of an application.  In Step 5
the configuration file is compiled into the TUXCONFIG file.

In the delivered version of STOCKAPP, the following parameters need 
to be checked:

IPCKEY 		This parameter may or may not need to be reset depending 
		on whether it is unique across the computer.  If yours is 
		the only application on the machine using IPC resources, 
		you can leave this value as is.

UID/GID 	Set the value for these to your user-id and group-id
		as displayed by the UNIX system command, id(1).

<SITE1's uname>	In the MACHINES section, substitute the node name 
		of your computer as displayed by the UNIX system
		command, uname -n

<TUXDIR>	The root directory of the TUXEDO System.

<APPDIR>	The directory from which you are running the application.


Step 4: Modify the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, SHLIB_PATH, and LIBPATH parameter in
        the ENVFILE.

<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>  Should be set to $TUXDIR/lib:$COBDIR/lib.
<SHLIB_PATH>  Should be set to $TUXDIR/lib:$COBDIR/lib.
<LIBPATH>  Should be set to $TUXDIR/lib:$COBDIR/lib.


Step 5: Edit and Run the makefile 

Edit STOCKAPP.mk and change TUXDIR and APPDIR to the same values as in 
STKVAR.  When you are satisfied that TUXDIR and APPDIR have the correct
values, enter the following command:

	nohup make -f STOCKAPP.mk install&

Check nohup.out to make sure the build was successful.


Step 6: Boot the Application Servers

This step must be done from the master site.  The environment variable
TUXCONFIG must be set and exported.  (This was done in Step 5, 
if you're following the complete procedure)

Use the following command to boot the application:

	tmboot -y

tmboot gives you feedback about servers started.

Step 7: When ready, shutdown the application with the following
        command:

        tmshutdown -y
