This is a brief description of the TUXEDO COBOL Simple Application.
A more comprehensive look can be found TUXEDO System Transaction Monitor 
COBOL Guide.

The Simple Application consists of a single server offering a single
service.  The client is run with a single argument, which is a string
to convert to upper case.  The client calls the service, which returns
the converted string.  The client then prints that string.

Example: CSIMPCL "Hello World"

 Returned string is: HELLO WORLD

This application runs a single server on a single machine.  It is
designed so that it can be up and running within minutes after
installing the TUXEDO COBOL software.

You should probably copy the CSIMPAPP files to your own directory,
since the configuration file must be edited and you might also
want to experiment with the client and server code.

The sample configuration file, UBBCSIMPLE, must be edited to replace
the bracketed items with values appropriate to your installation.
Your TUXDIR and TUXCONFIG environment variables must match the
values in the configuration file.  $TUXDIR/bin should be added
to your PATH variable.  On a SUN machine, make sure that /usr/5bin
appears at the beginning of your PATH.

Set the COBDIR environment variable to the installed COBOL directory
and export it.  Set the COBCPY environment variable to 
$TUXDIR/cobinclude and export it.

If you are using a version of the TUXEDO System that is built with
shared libraries (look for *.so* files in $TUXDIR/lib), you will need
to modify the envfile to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
SHLIB_PATH, and LIBPATH.
If you already have this variable set, append ":$TUXDIR/lib" to it.
(That's the expanded version of $TUXDIR, not the string '$TUXDIR'.)
If LD_LIBRARY_PATH, SHLIB_PATH, and LIBPATH are not yet set, set them to:
     $TUXDIR/lib:<PATH to COBOL installed directory>/coblib:/lib

After editing "UBBCSIMPLE", create the binary TUXCONFIG file with the command:

	tmloadcf UBBCSIMPLE
	(Answer "y" if it asks you whether it should proceed)

The client can be built with the command:

	buildclient -C -o CSIMPCL  -f CSIMPCL.cbl 

The server can be built with the command:

	buildserver -C -o CSIMPSRV -s CSIMPSRV -f CSIMPSRV.cbl -f TPSVRINIT.cbl

The Simple Application can be booted with the command:

	tmboot -y

Then you can run "CSIMPCL" as shown in the example above.
CSIMPCL can be run as many times as you wish.

When you are done, you can shut down the Simple Application with
the command:

	tmshutdown -y



Suggested next steps:

	Run more than one copy of the "simpserv" server, all operating
	from a single queue (Hint: See the RQADDR parameter in ubbconfig(5)).

	Configure a networked application, where the client and server
	run on different machines.

	Try the administrative command, "tmadmin", to display and
	modify the parameters of the running application.  (Try
	suspending the service, and then running the client.)
