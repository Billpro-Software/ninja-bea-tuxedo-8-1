#%%%%%%%%%%%%% Keywords used by all BEA SNMP Agent products%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
#1-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Define host, port and community for outgoing SNMP traps from this machine.
#TRAP_HOST       snmp_manager_host   162     public

#2-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Enable authentication failure trap when SNMP request with wrong community is
#  received
SNMP_ENABLE_AUTH_TRAP 1

#3-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  OID_CLASS can be used to override default set of MIBs registered by a 
#  subagent released by or developed using BEA SNMP Agent

# e.g. the following entry will make the TUXEDO agent connection export only 
# the tuxTdomain, tuxTmachine and tuxTserver MIB groups.
# OID_CLASS tux_snmpd .1.3.6.1.4.1.140.300.3 .1.3.6.1.4.1.140.300.5 \
# 		     .1.3.6.1.4.1.140.300.20

#%%%%%%%%%%%%% Keywords used by BEA Manger - Agent Connection %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

#4-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  TMAGENT keyword defines an agent for monitoring a particular TUXEDO domain#  on the local managed node. (when starting the agent the user needs to speci-
#  fy the logical agent name e.g. tux_snmpd -l <log_agent_name>)
#  This entry can be REPEATED if there are multiple domains running on the local#  node. 

#  TMAGENT <logical_agent_name(23)> <TUXDIR(256)> <TUXCONFIG(256)>
#  TMAGENT <logical_agent_name(23)> <TUXDIR(256)> <TUXCONFIG2(256)>

#  NOTE: 
#	1. TUXCONFIG file path must not be more than 256 characters long.
#	2. TUXDIR file path must not be more than 256 characters long.
#5-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  TMEVENT_FILTER defines a subset of TUXEDO events which agent connection needs
#  to forward as SNMP Traps. If no entries are specified - the default behaviour
#  is to forward all system events.
#  This entry can be REPEATED for the same or different logical agents.

#  TMEVENT_FILTER <filter_name(16)> <logical_agt_name(23)> \
		  <tux_expr|NONE(255)> <tux_filter|NONE(255)> <ACTIVE|INACTIVE>

#  PLEASE NOTE: Any field in TMEVENT_FILTER should not have white space.

#%%%%%%%%%%%%% Keywords used by BEA Manger - Agent Integrator %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

#6-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  NON_SMUX_PEER - configuration for SNMP Agents to be run in co-ordination with
#  Integrator. (It is not needed for SMUX subagents)

#  Example 1
#  Uncomment the following entry to access a mib-2 agent (running on 
#  port 161/udp) from an SNMP manager, through snmp_integrator.

#  NON_SMUX_PEER 161 * .1.3.6.1.2.1.2 .1.3.6.1.2.1.3 .1.3.6.1.2.1.4 \
	 	       .1.3.6.1.2.1.5 .1.3.6.1.2.1.6 .1.3.6.1.2.1.7 \
	 	       .1.3.6.1.2.1.8 .1.3.6.1.2.1.9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.10

#  Example 2
#  How to support different rows of a table by two different agents ?
#  In this example, .1.3.6.1.4.1.140.100.5 represents BeaExTable OID.
#  This table has 5 columns and Index is an integer.
#  Row with index = 1 is supported by agent running on port 5161 and row 
#  with index = 2 is supported by agent running on port 5162.

#  NON_SMUX_PEER 5161 * .1.3.6.1.4.1.140.100.5.1.1.1 \
			.1.3.6.1.4.1.140.100.5.1.2.1 \
		        .1.3.6.1.4.1.140.100.5.1.3.1 \
			.1.3.6.1.4.1.140.100.5.1.4.1 \
		        .1.3.6.1.4.1.140.100.5.1.5.1
 
#  NON_SMUX_PEER 5162 * .1.3.6.1.4.1.140.100.5.1.1.2 \
			.1.3.6.1.4.1.140.100.5.1.2.2 \
			.1.3.6.1.4.1.140.100.5.1.3.2 \

#  RULE_ACTION - define local polling rules for Agent Integrator
#  NOTE: rule id (name of the rule) should always be less than 8 chars.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sample Rules for Monitoring TUXEDO. (Please use or modify as needed)
# Items enclosed in '<>' need literal values before the rules can be used.
# Most rules are generic i.e. for all instances of the entity being monitored,
# if you need to monitor, say a specific server the '*' at the end of the OID
# needs to be replaced by the INDEX value of the specific instance to be monit-
# ered.

#  Alert if any server group is not active. (tuxTgroupState)
#  RULE_ACTION grpState 60 if ( VAL(140.300.4.1.1.4.*) != 1 ) \
			         { TRAPID_ERR = 300 TRAPID_OK = 301 }

#  Check if any machine the domain got partitioned. (tuxTmachineState)
#  RULE_ACTION mcState 60 if ( VAL(140.300.5.1.1.6.*) == 3 ) \
			     { TRAPID_ERR = 302 TRAPID_OK = 303 }

#  Check if TMSYSEVT is active. (tuxTsrvrName & tuxTsrvrState) 
#  If not TUXEDO system events will not be forwarded by Agent Connection. 
#  RULE_ACTION sysevtUp 60 if ( (VAL(140.300.20.1.1.3.*) >= "TMSYSEVT") && \
			        (VAL(140.300.20.1.1.5.*) != 1) ) \
			      { TRAPID_ERR = 304 TRAPID_OK = 305 }

#  Monitor Transaction States e.g. aborted(3).  (tuxTranState)
#  RULE_ACTION tranState 60 if (VAL(140.300.23.1.1.9.*) == 3) \
			     { TRAPID_ERR = 306 TRAPID_OK = 307 }

#  Monitor server queue size. (tuxTsvcSrvrNqueued)
#  In Tuxedo 6.3 onwards there is a provision to configure thresholds on queue 
#  sizes at which server instances can be spawned or shutdown as queue sizes 
#  go up and down respectively. Please see servopts(5) in TUXEDO Reference 
#  Manual.
#  Limitation: The object used in the rule below tuxTsvcSrvrNqueued is available
#  only in single machine applications when load balancing is enabled.

#  RULE_ACTION srvrQsz 60 if (VAL(140.300.10.2.1.15.*) > <THRESHOLD>) \
			     { TRAPID_ERR = 308 TRAPID_OK = 309 }

# /Q related rules

# Monitor number of messages in  application queues. (tuxTAppQcurMsg)
#  RULE_ACTION appqMsgs 60 if (VAL(140.300.12.1.1.15.*) > <THRESHOLD>) \
			     { TRAPID_ERR = 310 TRAPID_OK = 311 }

# INTEGRATOR_TIMEOUT keyword specifies  the timeout in seconds. After this time,
# integrator considers request not being answered by its sub-agents
# Example:
# INTEGRATOR_TIMEOUT 3

# INTEGRATOR_MAX_TIMEOUTS is the max number of timeouts allowed by integrator 
# for its sub-agents. After these timeouts, integrator disregards that 
# sub-agent.
# Example:
# INTEGRATOR_MAX_TIMEOUTS 3
