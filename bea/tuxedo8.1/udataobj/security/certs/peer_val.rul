# This file contains the list of rules for validating if 
# a peer is authorized as the target of a secure connection.
# 
# Each rule in the trusted peer rules file comprised of a set of elements that are
# identified by a key. The WLE product recognizes the key names listed below. 
#
#   Key     Attribute                   OID
#
#   CN      CommonName                  OID_commonName
#   SN      SurName                     OID_surName

# OID in the Subject Field of the certificate.
