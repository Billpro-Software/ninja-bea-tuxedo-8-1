<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
An attempt to connect to the TUXEDO application has
failed during a
tpchkauth()
call.
There are a number of reasons this could happen.
The most obvious ones are the network address,
WSNADDR ,
is incorrect or the network device,
WSDEVICE ,
is not specified or is incorrect.
Other possibilities for this failure are
the network may be down, the Workstation
Listener process may not be running, or the site of the Workstation Handler
may be down.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
The
WSNADDR
must be same as the listening address of the
Workstation Listener specified in the configuration file.
The
WSDEVICE
must be specified for TLI.
If these are not the problem, then check with the system
administrator for the status of the Workstation Listener
and its site.
Contact your TUXEDO System Technical Support for any other
problem.

<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
An attempt to connect to the TUXEDO System/T application has
failed during a
tpchkauth()
call.
There are a number of reasons this could happen.
The most obvious ones:
the network address,
WSNADDR ,

Other possibilities:
the network may be down, the

<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
The
WSNADDR
must be set to the listening address of the

specified in the configuration file.
WSDEVICE
is required for TLI.
If both settings are okay, check with the system
administrator for the status of the Workstation Listener

<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
An attempt to save a message failed.
There are two possible causes.
The first is that the environment variable
WSRPLYMAX
was set too high and an attempt to allocate space for the message failed.
The second is an attempt to write to a file opened
for temporary storage of a reply message failed.
This is an operating system error that
could be a result of insufficient space in the file system.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
In the first case, the value of
WSRPLYMAX
should be lowered.

<H2> ERROR: Unable to allocate system buffer</H2><HR>
<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
An attempt to allocate memory for a system buffer failed.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
The system can not operate without sufficient space for system buffers.
There are several strategies that an application can employ to solve
this problem.
Be sure there are no large application buffers that are not necessary.
If asynchronous messages are being used, the value of
WSRPLYMAX
could be lowered.
This will cause messages to be stored in temporary files rather than memory.
The client must be restarted to get the new value.
An alternative to the last solution is to do synchronous requests with
tpcall().
This will make it unnecessary to store replies.

Whenever an allocation of a system buffer fails, the advice is the same.
Try to reduce the memory usage of the application.

<H2> ERROR: Unknown buffer type</H2><HR>
<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
The application is attempting to send a broadcast message with an unknown type.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
The application must use a buffer obtained from
tpalloc()
to send an unsolicited message.
Either the application must be changed or the buffer type switch for this
client may need to be rebuilt with the new type.
Contact your TUXEDO System Technical Support for help with the latter.

<H2> ERROR: Unable to send tpabort() request, transaction will time-out</H2><HR>
<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
An attempt to send a request to abort a transaction failed.
The system will time the transaction out so it will eventually be aborted.
For that reason an error is not returned.
However, this is an indication of some other problem that should be
investigated.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
This problem is the result of either a network failure, or
the Workstation Handler or its site being down.
Contact your TUXEDO System administrator for advice with these problems.

<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
An attempt to receive a reply from the Workstation Handler process
failed during a
tpabort ().
This could be a result of the network going down, the Workstation
Handler process not running, or the site of the Workstation Handler
going down.
In any event, the transaction will be timed out.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
If any of the above problems happened, the client should be shut down
and restarted when the problem has been resolved.
This work should be coordinated with the TUXEDO System administrator.
