<H2> ERROR: Received message of unknown type '<I>type_name</I>' subtype '<I>subtype_name</I>'</H2><HR>
<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
The /Domain gateway received a message whose type and subtype are
not known.  That is, the gateway's type switch was not built to
recognize the type and/or subtype of the message received.
This may happen if the administrator has defined a new application
specific type as described in tuxtypes(5)
and has rebuilt some clients and/or servers with the new typeswitch,
but has forgotten to rebuild other clients and/or servers with the
new typeswitch.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
The /Domain gateway process should be re-linked with the appropriate
type switch including the type and subtype that are printed as
part of this error message.
Or, the process sending the offending type/subtype should be
altered to send a buffer that the gateway understands.

Make sure the operating system parameters are set correctly

<H2> ERROR: Reached UNIX limit on semaphore ids</H2><HR>
<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
The
GWADM
server could not create any more semaphore ids because the UNIX
system-imposed limit on the maximum number of allowed semaphores
system-wide would be exceeded.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
Use the
tmloadcf
-c
and
dmloadcf
-c
commands to determine the machine IPC resources
required by core System/T and by the /Domain feature.
Add to these values the IPC resources used by any
resource managers and/or other applications, and
reconfigure the system IPC resources appropriately.
Refer to the IPC tuning guidelines in the
"TUXEDO Installation Guide"
for further information.

<H2> ERROR: Can't create enough semaphores for GW</H2><HR>
<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
When a /Domain gateway group initializes, it creates one or
more sets of semaphores for serializing access to the /Domain
shared memory.
The number of semaphores created per gateway group is equal to the
number of server processes configured for that gateway group, plus 1.
This message is printed when the /Domain gateway group cannot
create as many semaphores as it needs.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
Since core System/T normally makes use of many more semaphores
than the /Domain add-on, attempts to reduce semaphore usage should
focus on core System/T.
If possible, decrease the value of
MAXACCESSERS
in the UBBCONFIG file to reduce core System/T semaphore usage.
If the MAX value for any /Domain server is set to a large value,
reduce this value in order to reduce the number of /Domain semaphores used.
If it is not possible to reduce semaphore usage for the existing
application, the
tmconfig -c
and dmconfig -c
commands can be run to determine the number of semaphores required by
core System/T and by the /Domain add-on.
Refer to the
"TUXEDO Installation Guide"
for further information regarding IPC parameters.

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
The process was unable to successfully unlock the gateway shared memory data
structures.
As a result of this problem, other processes will be unable to lock the
shared memory data structures.
The most common cause of this error is the accidental removal of some
or all of the gateway semaphore sets.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
Ask the privileged users on your system (normally the TUXEDO System/T administrator and
root )
whether they may have accidentally removed some IPC resource, perhaps
through inadvertent use of the UNIX System
ipcrm (1)
command.  If no IPC resources have been accidentally removed,
contact your TUXEDO System Technical Support.
