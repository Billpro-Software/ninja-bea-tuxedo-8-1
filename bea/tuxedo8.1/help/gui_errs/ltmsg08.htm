<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
The system key created and stored in the file
APPDIR/.adm/.keydb
for use by the
WSH
in security applications has become corrupted.  This
error disables the
WSH
from being able to handle new incoming connections
from workstation clients.
Note that current implementations of the security
interfaces within System/T will not generate this error, but future
ones may if they have more stringent requirements on the key characteristics
used for encryption.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
Shut down the application on the offending site, and remove the binary
TUXCONFIG
file and the key database APPDIR/.adm/.keydb.
Then reboot the site; this will automatically re-create the security
key information correctly.

<H2> ERROR: Unable to shutdown, clients/servers still attached</H2><HR>
<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
The
BBL
was unable to shut itself down because clients and/or servers
are still attached to the Bulletin Board.
It is the
BBL 's
responsibility to clean up and remove the Bulletin
Board prior to terminating.
However, the Bulletin Board was not removed since clients and/or
servers were still attached to it.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
First, make sure all application servers have been shut down prior to
attempting to shut down the
BBL .
The tmadmin(1) <Font>printserver (<Font>psr)
command can be used to print server statistics.
Shut down all application servers on that site using using tmshutdown(1)
with the -l option.
Second, make sure all application clients have terminated.
The tmadmin(1) <Font>printclient (<Font>pclt)
command can be used to print client statistics.
The application administrator can force the
BBL
to shut down, by invoking the
tmshutdown (1)
command with the
-c
option.
The
-c
option will allow for the
BBL
to be shut down
even if clients are still attached to the Bulletin Board.

<P>
Make sure the operating system parameters are set correctly
for the amount of memory on the machine and the amount of
memory that can be used by a process.
Reduce the memory usage on the machine or
increase the amount of physical memory on the machine.

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
The UNIX kernel call
unlink ()
failed on
<I>filename</I>
after it had been read.
This temporary file was being used to transfer a large message
between two TUXEDO System processes on the same machine.
Although the transfer succeeded,
the file could not be unlinked (deleted), and still is present
in the system's temporary file directory.
This might cause the file system to fill up.
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
Check directory and file permissions for the temporary files.
If the sticky bit is set for the directory, one user might not be
able to delete another user's files.
Check the
PERM
parameter in the *RESOURCES section of the configuration file.
As a temporary measure, delete
<I>filename</I>
manually.
It is no longer needed by the TUXEDO System.
If there are many such files, schedule a
cron
job to periodically delete files older than
a certain threshold.

<H3>LIBTUX MESSAGE #1296</H3>
<H2> WARN: Cannot retrieve own server group table entry</H2><HR>
<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
While booting, a server was unable to retrieve its own server table entry.
This particular failure by itself will not cause the server to be incapable
of processing service requests, but may be indicative of problems elsewhere
in the system.
<P>
If the output from
tmboot (1)
indicates that a prior attempt to boot this same server on a different
node had failed, the location of the server group in the bulletin board
and the
TUXCONFIG
file will not be updated to reflect the current location
of this server.
The server will still be active and able to receive requests,
but the first subsequent attempt to migrate the server will restart
the server on the same processor where it is now running.
Once this first subsequent migration occurs,
the server location will be stored consistently.
Also, if the configuration is shut down and rebooted,
tmboot (1)
will first attempt to start this server group on the processor where it is
not now running.
(Note that the condition mentioned in this paragraph will
not normally be the case.)
<SECT3><P>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
In the normal case, where
tmboot (1)
did not indicate that automatic server migration had occurred for this
server's group, no action is required.
However, this condition is likely
to be indicative of problems elsewhere in the system.
If
tmboot (1)
did indicate that automatic server group migration took place for this
server's group,
the administrator may wish to shut down and restart this
server group so that the group location is stored consistently.

<H2> INFO: Boot process migrating location of group <I>group_name</I> to machine <I>machine_name</I></H2><HR>
<P>
<SECT3><P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
The
tmboot (1)
process was unable to successfully boot group
<I>group_name</I>
on its current machine.
Therefore,
tmboot (1)
is migrating the location of this group to its alternate machine,
<I>machine_name</I>.
The first server in the group to be booted writes this message to the
userlog.
The group's migration is also noted in the output from
tmboot (1).
The group will remain located on
<I>machine_name</I>
until it is manually migrated to its former machine by the administrator,
or until a subsequent
tmboot (1)
detects that the group is unable to run on machine
<I>machine_name</I>,
but is able to run on the original machine name.
