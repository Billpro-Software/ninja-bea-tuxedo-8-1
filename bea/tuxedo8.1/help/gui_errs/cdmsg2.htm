<P>
<SECT3>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
mio
received an unsolicited message (tpbroadcast</> or
tpnotify )
and it could not determine the buffer type for processing.
The indicated TUXEDO System
error <I>tperrno</I> is the returned error indication from
the ATMI routine
tptypes ().
<SECT3>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
The most likely cause of this error is a non-TUXEDO System process
sending messages via Unix System queues and mistakenly putting one
such message on
mio 's
queue.
Examine other operations on your
system to ensure that this is not occurring.  Additionally, check
permissions specified in your
UBBCONFIG
file to allow write access
only as necessary.  If the problem cannot be resolved, then please
contact your TUXEDO System Technical Support.

<SECT3>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
mio
received an unsolicited message (tpbroadcast</> or
tpnotify )
with an unsupported buffer type.
mio
supports unsolicited messages with
either the
FML
or
STRING
buffer type only.  The indicated message will
be ignored and
mio
will continue processing.
<SECT3>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
Check application clients and servers that send unsolicited messages to see
what buffer types are being used.
Correct improper uses to use only
FML
or
STRING
buffer types when communicating with what may be an
mio
client.

<P>
<SECT3>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
An error occurred while attempting to join the system.
Additional information will be printed to
give more details about the problem.
The
information
may have one of two formats.
	1. <I>TUX_error_information</I>
	2. <I>sys_call_info</I> operating system error: <I>UNIX_error_information</I>
Form 1 is used for all TUXEDO System errors, and form 2 is used for
all operating system errors.
<I>TUX_error_information</I> is a textual description of the
error code returned from a call to tpinit</>(), for example,
TPEINVAL
would map to the string ``invalid arguments given''.
<I>sys_call_info</I>
is an indication of a UNIX system call that
resulted in the error, for example, a failure on a call to msgsnd</>()
would result in the string ``msgsnd'' being used.
<I>UNIX_error_information</I>
is a mapping of the UNIX
errno
value to
a textual description of the error code.
<SECT3>
<H3>ACTION</H3>
<P>
Action for this failure depends on the actual error returned.
If the error is a TUXEDO System error (form 1 above) and ``no entry found''
is displayed, then this indicates that space limitations in the configured
application have been reached.
The application administrator should reconfigure
the application to accommodate additional users.
If ``bad permissions'' is displayed, then this indicates that either UNIX
permissions or application security has kept mio</> from joining the
system.
Contact your application administrator for further clarification
in this case.
For all other error indications, please contact your TUXEDO System Technical Support.
