<H1>Configure JDBC Data Sources</H1>
<p>Use this screen to configure the JDBC data sources defined in your domain source.</p>
<p>A JDBC data source contains a pool of database connections that are created when the data source instance is created &mdash; when it is deployed or targeted, or at server startup. Applications look up a data source on the JNDI tree, and then request a connection. When the applications no longer need the connections, they return the connections to the connection pool in the data source.</p>
<p>The JDBC data sources associated with the products for which you are creating the domain are listed in the lower half of the screen.</p>
<p> <strong>Note</strong>: If you want to configure one or more of the data sources as RAC data sources, select the check boxes adjacent to the name of the required data sources, and select the <strong>Configure selected data sources as RAC multi data sources in the next panel</strong> check box. Then, click the <strong>Next</strong> button. </p>
<ol>
<li>Select the data source for which you want to specify  settings by selecting the check box adjacent to the data source name.
  <p class="list_para"><strong>Note</strong>: When you select multiple data sources, the text &#8220;<span class="code">Varies among data sources</span>&#8221; might be displayed in certain fields, indicating that the current values of those fields are not the same across the selected data sources. If you go ahead and change the values in such fields, the new values  are applied uniformly across the selected data sources.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The default values of data source parameters such as vendor, driver, host name, and port number depend on the values that are specified in the application templates.</p>
</li>

<li>Review the current configuration settings and change them as required.
  <p class="list_para">The following table describes the fields in this screen.</p><p class="list_para"><strong>Note</strong>: The default values of data source parameters such as vendor, driver, host name, and port number depend on the values  that are specified in the application templates.</p>
